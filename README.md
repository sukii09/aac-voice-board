 ## What is this web based platform?

I've created an AAC Voice Board on a web based format, it is a simple Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) tool designed for non verbal individuals to express their needs, preferences, and feelings through visuals and speech. 

This is a lightweight, accessible prototype created to support individuals with autism, intellectual disabilities, or speech impairments, particularly in care and educational settings.


## Why did I decide to build something like this? 

I've always been passionate about supporting individuals with disabilities, not just from the outside, but by working directly with them. I’ve seen how powerful the right tools can be in empowering those who communicate differently.

At the same time, I’ve developed a strong passion for technology, design, and experimentation. This project is my way of combining those two worlds: creating something meaningful at the intersection of **tech and human impact**.

This AAC board is an ongoing exploration of how accessible tools can be designed simply, yet effectively.

What’s yet to be implemented:
-  Integrate APIs like ElevenLabs for more natural, expressive voices
- Improve the UI to be more visually friendly and customizable
- Add accessibility features for better keyboard and screen reader support
- Expand categories and add sign language GIFs for carers and educators (auslan)



## Features
